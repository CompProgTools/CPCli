Table of Contents Installation First Time Setup Setting Up Templates Syncing Accounts Testing Code LeetCode Commands Codeforces Commands Statistics Installation To install Kruskal, go to the releases tab on the Github Repository and install whichever fits your operating system! Note: Kruskal currently has support for Mac Silicon and Windows 64-Bit, there are more supported versions coming soon. Mac OS Installation Setting up the application for MacOS is quite easy. Once you have the latest release from the releases tab , make sure you copy the full path of the installed file. Go to the terminal and type: chmod +x <path of the install> Once that is done and there are no errors , the app should be compiled for your computer. To check, go to the folder in which the file is located and type ls . If the app name appears then you are good to go! You may now type in ./freeport And the application should open up. Conga rats! You just installed Kruskal :D Test the output, does it match the following? Hi! This is Kruskal, a command line tool for competitive programmers ? What would you like to do? > View Repository Coming soon... Exit If it matches the output above, your installation of kruskal is good to go! First Time Setup Now that you've got Kruskal installed, it's important to set it up properly in order to have a good experience! We will now setup the account(s) on LeetCode and Codeforces In order to do the first time setup, run: kruskal config [Note for reviewer, you may use kashsuks as the username for both codeforces and leetcode if you do not have an account] The config subcommand allows you to set your name, preferred language, code editor, Codeforces username, Leetcode username, and the template output folder. The only confusing one should be the tempalate output folder, so you can skip that and configure everything else to your liking. Once thats done you can go to .cpcli/config.json file and make sure everything is right. REMEMBER: All your config files and everything else will be stored in the .cpcli folder. Once you've setup your profiles, run kruskal sync . This command fetches the rating for the account(s), if this command works successfully that means your accounts are good to go!. You can move onto the next step. KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS ONLY WORKS IF YOU HAVE A RATING ON EITHER SITE Setting Up Templates In order to setup a template, you must first understand what a template is. A template is basically pre-written code that is used to speed up the process during the contest. Here is Tourists template for multithreaded programming. It's important to have a good templates that works for you . While using someone elses template is a good start, you write well with your own template. In order to create and use a template that Kruskal can recognize, run the command: kruskal template --make name.ext --alias alias BUT WAIT In order to run this command you must first understand what each part means. The template subcommand is a collection of flags under the location subcommands/template.go . It contains 4 main commands: --make : This flag allows you to create a template file under the location .cpcli/templates following the --make flag, you must put the filename of your extension in the format filename.extension . This flag must be followed up by the --alias flag. --alias : This flag allows you to give a template an alias. In the last flag you were taught how to assign a template, in this one, you will be naming it. An alias is just a name you assign to a template for easy access. Moving onto actually using the template. In order to use the template during a contest, here is the command: kruskal template --use alias --filename name.ext This command uses the same concepts as the last, but with a few changes in the flags used. --use : The use flag is to be used in order to call a template by its alias. --filename : The filename flag is used to create a filename with the format filename.extension . This simple yet powerful command opens up a file at the location defined in the config command at kruskal config . This is what the Set Template Output Folder option was meant for. Setting a location in this command means that when you use the use and filename flag command, a file is created at the location defined under Set Template Output Folder with the selected template alias. You can also use the --list flag in order to list all your teamplates, their aliases, and their template file names. Here is the usage: kruskal template --list Syncing Accounts If you setup your account(s) using the config command, you can fetch their ratings using the command: kruskal sync This will show your changes in rating (if any). Learning How To Test Code If you would like to quick test your code by using custom testcases (stdin/stdout) you can do so by using the following command: kruskal test filename.extension The format here is pretty simple to follow, but for the filename, make sure to put the full path or else Kruskal wont reccognize it as a file in the source directory. Once you enter the command, you will be asked to ask the number of testcases, which must be an integer , after which you can enter the input for the testcase as well as the output. LeetCode Specific Commands As of now, the only LeetCode specific command is the daily subcommand. Here is how to use it: kruskal daily This will display todays daily question in a table format. Codeforces Specific Commands Since the Codeforces API is much more diverse when compared to the third-party LeetCode API, you can expect much more commands to show up. In order to use any Codeforces command, here is the format: kruskal cf --flag As of now, Kruskal offers two commands: --list : This flag allows you to list upcoming contests in a nice table like format. --solved <contestId>/<index> : This flag allows you to log a problem you've solved. The format is contestId/Index. Every problem on codeforces comes from a contest, so the id of the contest not the contest number and the index is which problem it is in a letter format. Statistics Commands In order to track your progress so far, I've made some subcommands to check number of problems solved, common tags, average rating, etc. These stats include general pieces of info that I find useful, but if you want to contribute and add onto, feel free to do so. Here are the statistics commands: stats : The stats command gives a general overview of your highest streak, number of problems solved, highest rating, average rating, etc. This command should be enough for most users, but you can customize as you want.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-the-kruskal-documentation-site","text":"This is where you can find quick documentation for the commands and how to use them.","title":"Welcome to the Kruskal Documentation Site"},{"location":"#table-of-contents","text":"Installation First Time Setup Setting Up Templates Syncing Accounts Testing Code LeetCode Commands Codeforces Commands Statistics","title":"Table of Contents"},{"location":"#installation","text":"To install Kruskal, go to the releases tab on the Github Repository and install whichever fits your operating system!

Built by Kashyap Sukshavasi @kashsuks as a part of Hack Clubs Summer of Making Event and Hack Clubs Flavortow Event As a competitive programmer myself, I have felt that the community isn't widely recognized and doesn't have good tools for competitive programmers. You see other tools to improve workflow for hackathons to generate ideas or find teammates, but competitive programming doesn't have that kind of tools. Even if they do, they don't get the recognition they deserve. Thats why I built this tool. I realized that creating and using templates was a pretty tedious task, so I wanted to write a quick script for this. That was how Kruskal was born. The quick script was very helpful, so I decided to expand to more things. The only mainstream tool to sync stats and have a quick overview of all your profiles is Clist . Thats why I decided to add a sync feature in order to get a quick glance of my accounts. This project wasn't a very original thought of mine, while there were tools on Github pretty similar to mine, I felt that their backend or the way the project works wasn't to my liking, so I made my own. Kruskal was heavily influenced by cpt by cp-tools.
