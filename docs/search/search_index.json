Built by Kashyap Sukshavasi @kashsuks as a part of Hack Clubs Summer of Making Event As a competitive programmer myself, I have felt that the community isn't widely recognized and doesn't have good tools for competitive programmers. You see other tools to improve workflow for hackathons to generate ideas or find teammates, but competitive programming doesn't have that kind of tools. Even if they do, they don't get the recognition they deserve. Thats why I built this tool. I realized that creating and using templates was a pretty tedious task, so I wanted to write a quick script for this. That was how CP-Cli was born. The quick script was very helpful, so I decided to expand to more things. The only mainstream tool to sync stats and have a quick overview of all your profiles is Clist . Thats why I decided to add a sync feature in order to get a quick glance of my accounts. This project wasn't a very original thought of mine, while there were tools on Github pretty similar to mine, I felt that their backend or the way the project works wasn't to my liking, so I made my own. CP-Cli was heavily influenced by cpt by cp-tools. Feel free to check them out, and give them a star!","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#about","text":"CP-Cli is a CLI tool meant for competitive programmers to increase worflow and speed during contests.
