# How to Contribute to CP-Cli

CP-Cli was a tool I made for competitive programmers to have a platform/tool to easily access quick commands and general workflow optimisations during contests. We see these kinds of tools all across the tech industry, through hackathon idea generators, or task assigning tools, there are lots of apps out there for different parts of the field. Competitive Programming however doesn't have that many tools, there are platforms such as Codeforces and Codechef but they serve the task of providing problems.

CP-Cli however aims to improve speed and general comfort for competitive programmers, taking the tedious tasks off their mind and allowing them to focus on the important things.


If you want to contribute to this project, it is important that you understand this, and apply it in your perspective. If you are able to think like a competitive programmer, you can definitely build amazing software for them!
