## Installation

The installation process of [CP-Cli](https://github.com/CompProgTools/CPCli) is quite simple, as of now, its just a project with python files, but sooner of later, I will turn it into `.exe`, `.dmg`/`.app`, and installations for Linux devices.

As of now, here are the installation steps:
- Clone the repository from Github
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/CompProgTools/CPCli
```
- Change directory into the repository location
```
bash
cd CPCli
```
- Run the python file
```bash
python3 main.py
```

- Test the output, does it match the following?
```bash
Hi! This is CPCli, a command line tool for competitive programmers
