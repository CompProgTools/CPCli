# How to contribute to CP-Cli

In order to contribute to this project, you must really understand what competitive programmers want from a tool like this. Speak to other competitive programmers, hand them this! See what they think about this, and get feedback. Without understanding your userbase, it will be much harder to make the product *actually* good.

## Am I open to contributions?

Yes! CP-Cli is fully open source under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit) and is open to any contributions you would like to make! This project is solely for the ease of competitive programmers

## How can I contribute?

If you would like to contribute to the project, please **make a fork** and make changes on your fork. Once you feel like the changes are polished and completed, **make a pull request**. 

**Disclaimer: I might not be online all the time, so feel free to email me if you think it is urgent!**

## Criteria for merging changes

This is the criteria of which I approve or reject your pull requests.

1. Is the feature or changes *actually* useful to users?
    - If the feature is unnecessary or doesn't help the users in any way, I will reject the changes.
    - If the changes are too small to be noticed or they dont change the user experience.
2. Does the feature already exist in a simpler manner?
    - This one is a bit more confusing and subjective. Essentially, can this feature be implemented in a simpler format, one that takes less resources, or less visual clutter, etc.

**Here are some amazing examples of what might be good changes**
- Making the codebase more secure or more efficient with resources
- Adding a key feature
- Improving UI or adding more customization
- Improving workflow and speed

## How can I be more involved?

If you would like to be more involved in the development on *CP-Cli* then contribute a lot! Thats really all I have to say, oh and also show that you actually care about the competitive programming community, and I might add you as a contributer!
